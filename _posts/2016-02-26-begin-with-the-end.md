title: Begin With the End In Mind
author: LB
pitch: My early songwriting did not generally <a href="https://www.stephencovey.com/7habits/7habits-habit2.php">begin with the end in mind</a>. Instead, my early songs were like disparate parts assembled to make a whole. My early songwriting resembled <a href="http://disney.wikia.com/wiki/Bing_Bong">Bing Bong</a>.

Don't get me wrong - I wrote some cool stuff. And it wasn't that the arrangement jumped around aimlessly. It was that the process didn't scale. I couldn't actually finish songs. I was a keyboard player. I intentionally worked for esoteric chord progressions. I rarely got around to the melody or lyrics. By the time I wrote each part, glued them together and did some basic arranging, I was out of energy.

Most of the time, I started with the beat - and when I say beat, I literally mean the drums. I never prescribed a message or feeling - I thought it was best to let that happen organically - you know, like _real_ songwriters do. Instead of driving the music, I let the music drive me. I just kept adding, removing or thinning out layers until something reasonable came out.

How did this happen? I was in a band. I could tear down a song and play it by ear. I was a smart kid but I didn't reverse engineer songwriting very well.

We're about the change all that.
