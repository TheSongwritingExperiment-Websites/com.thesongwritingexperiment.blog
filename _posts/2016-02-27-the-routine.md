title: The Routine
---

Sometime in the 80s and 90s I played [keyboard](http://www.vintagesynth.com/roland/jx3p.php) in an R&B band and spent my free time writing songs. After college, I found it hard to make any sort of living on songwriting so at some point; I changed focus and went back to school. And while I became a computer programmer and eventually started a family - I never lost my underlying passion and zeal and for wanting to be known as a pop music songwriter/producer.

Roughly 5 years ago, we moved and I came across all my old music equipment - tucked away in the basement. I immediately felt a surge of excitement as a few memories flashed in front of me and I quickly decided it might be fun to finish try and pick up where I'd left off.

For the past 5 years then, I've spent some of my free time analyzing where I went wrong. While somewhat naive, I've taken a few [online classes at Berklee](https://online.berklee.edu/courses/music-production-analysis) and have been listening _differently_ in the car on my way into work. I maintain a full time job and have a family so I have to find creative ways to work toward this but turns out, there's something interesting about working slowly and with so many gaps between time at the keyboard.

My youngest is a toddler now so I've decided to pursue the following routine. I'm posting here so, well, maybe you'll join me in my quest! The ultimate key for the routine is to get quality time writing and arranging but we'll have to wait and see just how consistent I can be. Admittedly, the routine is largely centered around finishing things and getting things done - even if they are less then perfect. I've broken the routine into 4 initiatives: **daily**, **weekly**, **monthly** and **annual**. The breakdown delineations aren't carved in stone but I've attached a few details here in an effort to convey how I see the work falling out.

### Daily

   - Idea generation and expansion.
   - Write and arrange around a riffy phrase, song or song section every day.
   - Light. Easy. Going for quantity. Don't think about it too much. Finish. Finish. Finish.
   - Vertical slices, not much in terms of a song but deeper dive in terms of a section.
   - Can be spontaneous musically driven ideas with no higher purpose in mind but to sound clever or professional.
   - Get comfortable working with an objective or goal in mind. Ultimately, this is where I need to be.
   - What am I trying to say and then setting out to say it. Review and then consider working to convey a message in your musical ideas.
   - My objective is to get better at
     - listening and reacting in a intuitive way &hellip; and then get better at
	 - listening and reacting in the _context_ of a larger goal.

### Weekly

   - Finish a complete song draft.
   - Review daily ideas. Pick one to build out.
   - Now, start with why. Think about the message, who are you talking to and what do you want to say to them.
   - Try to stay true to the original intent, or, to _some_ intent.
   - This work is on a slightly broader, higher horizon then the daily work.
   - Again, finish finish finish!
   - Take the entire week.
   - Focus a bit on the _whole_ each day.
   - Avoid being too prescriptive but consider focusing on a section each day
     - Monday=Hook
	 - Tuesday=Verse
	 - Wednesday=Lift
	 - Thursday=Core
	 - Friday=Intro, Transitions, Outtro
   - Doesn't need to be perfect - but should be more deeply considered w/r/t a simple daily idea.

### Monthly

  - Pick from one of the weekly drafts
  - Finish something for _real._ I don't have _demo_ mixing chops nor can I sing but I need to set aside time to take a holistic view of the song and build on it for a month.
  - More production.
  - Precursor to actual studio time. These are the songs I would shop around to demo singers.

### Annually

  - Finish an album.
  - This simply follows from the monthly initiative.
  - 12 months and I should have 12 songs!
