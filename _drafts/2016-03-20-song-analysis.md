title: Song Analysis Is a <span class="strikeout">Helpful</span> Necessary Exercise
author: LB
pitch: Is this true? Specifically, I am positing that analyzing popular pop songs (<a href="http://www.billboard.com/charts">Billboad Charts</a>) can be a helpful/necessary exercise for any budding pop songwriter. To figure this out, let's explore what I mean a bit more. Let's dig into <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> before we focus on the <strong>what</strong>. In the process - let's hope I can convince you of some of the merits of the exercise.

As with most anything one does, let's begin by asking ourselves <q>Why would I want to analyze songs currently on the charts.</q>

## Why Analyze Current Hits?

To answer that question, let's step back a bit - why are you doing any of this? Is it because you love and are passionate about writing pop music? Really? If there were no other people on the planet, do you find would you sit around and write pop music? While that sentiment may certainly be helpul to have, I dare say it isn't why many of us engage in writing pop music.

While not true for everyone, there were 4 stages I went through before really deciding I wanted to write **pop**ular music.

### Playing


Playing, performing, living? writing


It is my conjecture that, on some level, many of us simply want to make a *living* writing music. In truth, many of us got started by *playing* music and as such, we found that we actually enjoy playing, writing, and even listening to music, all kinds of music. The attraction of writing **pop**ular music then is related to the fact that it seems so pervasive around us. We feel there is less risk and potentially greater payoff in a vocation centered around writing **pop**ular music professionally.

## Main Point

Writing pop music is a learned skill. You aren't born with it. Don't be discouraged if it doesn't come easy. It is a largely a mechanical process infused with your own personal creativity such that, if you've got the mechanics down, you music cannot help but be a hit.

It is hard. It takes hard work. It requires focus and a specific way of thinking. You've got to align the stars and concentrate on making something very specific. You can't just sit down and pour it out linearly from beginning to end. It involves evaluation and editing.

### Instructional

Consequently, it is both instrucional and inspiring to listen and deeply analyze what other folks are doing now, in your space. In the space you want to be.

### Move Us Forward

Your goal is not to rewrite pop music. It is to get in and then bend it to your will. You can redefine the music we define as Pop music but you have to do it from the inside. Don't think that we all need to just listen to your inspiration. You need to demonstate mastery of the art, and then take us to a new place.

### Review

Master the current art.

Get yourself heard.

Become consistent. Master the mechanics and infuse your creativity.

Bend the direction of pop music as a whole.

## Goal

Make this part of your weekly routine.

Do it in the car.

Become heady about it.
